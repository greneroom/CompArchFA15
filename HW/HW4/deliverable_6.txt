The above module outputs a 32 bit wire, with 31 of the bits set to 0, and one bit set to either 1 or 0, depending on if enable=1. This module takes in a number i from 0-31 in the form of a 5-bit wire, then sets the ith bit of the output to enable. This is done by taking enable and then left shifting it by address.

For example, address = 00010 (address=2), and enable=1, our expected output is 00000000000000000000000000000100 (the 2nd bit is 1). We take enable, which is 1, and shift it left 2, to get 100. This is the expected output.
